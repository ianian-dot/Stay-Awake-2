## M1: ====================================================================================
## Get durations from user :

## M2: ====================================================================================
## Create a dynamic function that takes 5 mins as default if the user didnt enter a value within
## a period of time 
## This is useful is the user runs the function and leaves the computer before entering in the integer

## Logging actions onto text file:
